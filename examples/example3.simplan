    This example shows the problems arising with aliasing.
    While f is perfectly correct, if we were to declare a pointer like this:
      ^int x = new int;
    and use it in the following statement:
      f(x, x);
    then the program should display:
      - "Variable x is used after deletion."
    */
    ^int x = new int;
    void f(^int x, ^int y) {
        delete x;
        delete y;
    }

    f(x,x);
}
